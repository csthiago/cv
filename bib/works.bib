	abstract = {Introduction: Burnout syndrome is highly prevalent among medical students. Whereas burnout syndrome has been associated with negative outcomes, like suicidal ideation, protective factors are still unknown.
Objective: To evaluate if there is an association between burnout syndrome and resilience in medical students, assessing covariates such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and religiosity.
Method: This cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 209 students from a medical school in Brazil. Burnout syndrome was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory – Student Survey. Potential protective factors and aggravators to burnout syndrome were investigated using appropriate scales.
Results: Fifty-nine students (28.2\%) presented burnout. Multivariate analysis showed that resilience was a protective factor (p {\textless} 0.001), along with being older, married or having better academic performance. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with burnout. Religiosity was not a protective factor and suicidal ideation was not associated with burnout when adjusted for depressive symptoms.
Conclusion: Burnout is frequent among medical students, impacting mental health and academic performance. Resilience seems to be a protective factor, and the relationship between burnout and suicidal ideation is possibly mediated by depressive symptoms. Prospective studies are needed to further investigate the associations found in this study.},

	abstract = {Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) promotes challenging immune and inflammatory phenomena. Though various therapeutic possibilities have been tested against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most adequate treatment has not yet been established. Propolis is a natural product with considerable evidence of immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, and experimental data point to potential against viral targets. We hypothesized that propolis can reduce the negative effects of COVID-19.
Methods
In a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center trial, hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients were treated with a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF®️) as an adjunct therapy. Patients were allocated to receive standard care plus an oral dose of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis for seven days, or standard care alone. Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency duration. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Patients were followed for 28 days after admission.
Results
We enrolled 124 patients; 40 were assigned to EPP-AF®️ 400 mg/day, 42 to EPP-AF®️ 800 mg/day, and 42 to the control group. The length of hospital stay post-intervention was shorter in both propolis groups than in the control group; lower dose, median 7 days versus 12 days (95\% confidence interval [CI] −6.23 to −0.07; p = 0.049) and higher dose, median 6 days versus 12 days (95\% CI −7.00 to −1.09; p = 0.009). Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. In the high dose propolis group, there was a lower rate of acute kidney injury than in the controls (4.8 vs 23.8\%), (odds ratio [OR] 0.18; 95\% CI 0.03–0.84; p = 0.048). No patient had propolis treatment discontinued due to adverse events.
Conclusions
Addition of propolis to the standard care procedures resulted in clinical benefits for the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially evidenced by a reduction in the length of hospital stay. Consequently, we conclude that propolis can reduce the impact of COVID-19.},

	doi = {10.1177/17474930211006284},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chagas disease is a common cause of heart failure (HF) and death in developing countries. Although stroke is known to occur in these patients, an accurate estimate of stroke incidence is lacking. We aimed to determine the incidence of stroke and death in patients with HF, comparing Chagas and non-Chagas etiologies.
METHODS: Cohort of stroke-free patients with HF (Framingham criteria) followed in a university-based outpatient clinic in Brazil. Baseline characteristics included sociodemographic, risk factor assessment, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings. Chagas disease was defined by appropriate serologic tests. Cause-specific Cox regression was used to search for predictors of stroke or death as separate outcomes.
RESULTS: We studied 565 patients with HF between January 2003 and December 2018, mean age 54.3 ± 12.9 years, 305 (54.0\%) females, 271/535 (50.7\%) with Chagas disease. Chagas patients were older (55.5 vs. 53.1 years), more frequently women (60.5\% vs. 47.3\%), less frequently harbored coronary artery disease (14.5\% vs. 34.1\%) when compared to non-Chagas patients. Echocardiography showed more severe disease among non-Chagas patients [median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) 37.3\% vs. 47.0\%]. Over a mean 42.9 (±34.4) months, we followed 404 (71.5\%) patients, completing 1442 patient-years of follow-up. Stroke incidence was higher in Chagas when compared to non-Chagas patients (20.2 vs. 13.9 events per 1000 patient-years), while death rate was similar (41.6 vs. 43.1 deaths per 1000 patient-years). In the multivariable analysis for stroke outcome adjusted for LVEF and arrhythmias, cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) for Chagas was 2.54 (95\% confidence interval 1.01-6.42, p = 0.048). Chagas disease was also associated with increased risk of death (CSHR 1.83; 95\% confidence interval 1.04-3.24, p = 0.037).
CONCLUSION: Chagas disease is associated with increased risk of stroke and death when compared to other etiologies of HF, independently of HF severity or cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting other factors contribute to increased stroke risk and mortality in Chagas disease. Early prevention and treatment of Chagas disease is imperative to reduce a later risk of stroke in endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Background
Aging influences COVID-19 severity and response to vaccination, but previous vaccine effectiveness (VE) analyzes lack the power to evaluate its role in subgroups within the elderly age group. Here we analyzed the impact of age on viral vector and inactivated virus vaccines' effectiveness, the main platforms used in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods
We report a retrospective longitudinal study of 75,919,840 Brazilian vaccinees from January 18 to July 24, 2021, evaluating documented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19-related hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death. Negative binomial regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics were used for VE estimation.
Findings
The overall analyzes of full vaccination showed VE against hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death of 91·4\% (95\%CI:90·1–92·5), 91·1\% (95\%CI:88·9–92·9) and 92·3\% (95\%CI:90·5–93·7) for Vaxzevria and 71·2\% (95\%CI:70·0–72·4), 72·2\% (95\%CI:70·2–74·0) and 73·7\% (95\%CI:72·1–75·2) for CoronaVac, respectively. VE for all outcomes is progressively lower with age. In fully-Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals aged {\textless}60 years, VE against death was 96.5\% (95\%CI:82.1–99.3) versus 68·5\% (95\%CI:40·0–83·4) in those ≥90 years. Among fully-CoronaVac-vaccinated individuals, VE against death was 84.8\% (95\%CI:77.1–89.9) in those {\textless}60 years compared to 63.5 (95\%CI 58.7–67.7) for vaccinees aged 80–89 years and 48·6\%; (95\%CI:35·0–59·3) for individuals aged ≥90 years. Post-vaccination daily cumulative incidence curves for all outcomes showed increased risk from younger to elder decades of life. There was no increase in the incidence of hospitalisation for individuals {\textless}60 years vaccinated during the same period as those aged ≥90 years.
Interpretation
Although both vaccines have been effective in protecting against infection, hospitalization and death; Vaxzevria and CoronaVac demonstrated high effectiveness against severe outcomes for individuals up to 79 years of age. Our results reinforce the idea that booster doses should be carefully considered in elders.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Chagas disease (CD) mainly conveys stroke risk through structural cardiac disease. However, stroke and cognitive impairment are seen in CD independently of cardiac disease severity. Chronic inflammation may be an explanation for this association, because inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke and dementia. In the present study, we selected five candidate biomarkers for Chagas disease: interleukin-6, membrane metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), orosomucoid, and neprilysin. We sought to determine if mean levels of proinflammatory biomarkers are higher in patients with heart failure (HF) associated with Chagas disease when compared with other etiologies of HF. Patients were consecutively enrolled from subspecialty HF outpatient clinics at two university-based hospitals. Serum biomarker levels from blood samples were analyzed by ELISA. Severity of HF on echocardiography was worse in non-CD when compared with CD patients. No significant difference was observed in the levels of candidate biomarkers between the CD and non-CD groups. We found a significantly 2.2 ng/mL higher level of TIMP1 in CD when compared with non-CD patients with HF after adjustment for age and gender (95\% confidence interval = 0.1 to 4.5, P = 0.037). In patients with heart failure, serum TIMP1 is increased in Chagas patients despite a lower myocardial disease severity on echocardiography when compared with non-Chagas patients. TIMP1 is probably one of multiple mediators of inflammatory injury.},

	abstract = {Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present in 60\% to 70\% of stroke patients. Cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with stroke and OSA has not been well studied and could identify a new pathophysiologic mechanism with potential therapeutic intervention. We aimed to determine whether risk categories for OSA are associated with cerebral vasoreactivity in stroke patients.

Methods and Results

In this cross‐sectional study of a cohort of patients with stroke, we used clinical questionnaires (Sleep Obstructive Apnea Score Optimized for Stroke [SOS] and snoring, tiredness, observed, pressure, bmi, age, neck, gender [STOP‐BANG] scores) to assess the risk of OSA and transcranial Doppler to assess cerebral vasoreactivity (breath‐holding index and visual evoked flow velocity response). Of the 99 patients included, 77 (78\%) had medium or high risk of OSA and 80 performed transcranial Doppler. Mean breath‐holding index was 0.52±0.37, and median visual evoked flow velocity response was 10.8\% (interquartile range: 8.8–14.5); 54 of 78 (69\%) showed impaired anterior circulation vasoreactivity (breath‐holding index {\textless}0.69) and 53 of 71 (75\%) showed impaired posterior circulation vasoreactivity (visual evoked flow velocity response ≤14.0\%). There was a significant negative correlation between the risk of OSA calculated by STOP‐BANG and the breath‐holding index (rS=−0.284, P=0.012). The following variables were associated with low anterior circulation vasoreactivity: dyslipidemia (odds ratio: 4.7; 95\% CI, 1.5–14.2) and STOP‐BANG score (odds ratio: 1.7 per 1‐point increase; 95\% CI, 1.1–1.5).

Conclusions

A high risk of OSA and impaired vasoreactivity exists in the population that has had stroke. Dyslipidemia and STOP‐BANG sleep apnea risk categories were independently associated with impaired anterior circulation vasoreactivity.},
