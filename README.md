# Thiago Cerqueira Silva's Academic CV

My CV created with [vitae package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae/), based mostly on the version from [JooYoung](https://github.com/jooyoungseo/jy_CV).

Some differences:

- All data files are extracted from a googlesheets via [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/)
- Publications are extracted from my ORCID profile
- Support to icons in the headers (adaptaded from [Lorena Abad](https://github.com/loreabad6/R-CV))


Minor improvements
- Some comments about LaTeX formatation (awesome-cv.cls)

Small documentation about LaTeX fonts https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/latinmodernmono/
